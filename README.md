## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a database administrator (DBA) with a focus on managing large-scale Oracle database systems for high availability, performance, and security. This repository contains scripts, configurations, and guides that reflect real-world practices in performance tuning, data migration, and database security for enterprise environments.

Oracle databases are widely used in mission-critical applications, where efficiency and stability are paramount. My work involves proactively maintaining and optimizing these systems to support high transaction volumes and complex workloads with minimal downtime.

Performance Tuning: The repository includes SQL tuning scripts, AWR (Automatic Workload Repository) analysis methods, and indexing strategies aimed at improving query performance and reducing resource contention. I also provide examples of optimizer hints, execution plan analysis, and techniques for resolving common bottlenecks.

Data Migration: Moving large datasets between environmentsâ€”whether on-premises or to cloud infrastructureâ€”requires precision and reliability. This repository offers data pump export/import procedures, transportable tablespace setups, and tools for validating data integrity post-migration. Step-by-step guides help ensure smooth transitions between Oracle versions or systems.

Security Best Practices: Database security is a top priority. Included are recommendations and scripts for user management, privilege auditing, encryption configuration (TDE), and implementing Oracle Database Vault and auditing features. These practices help enforce least privilege access and compliance with data protection regulations.

This repository is a valuable resource for DBAs, system architects, and IT professionals who manage and maintain Oracle environments. Each script and document is well-commented and structured to support learning, customization, and production use.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or adapt these tools to fit your own Oracle database environment. Letâ€™s keep data fast, secure, and reliable.
